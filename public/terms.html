    <h2>4. Weather & Safety Policy</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Wind Conditions:</strong> Operations will be suspended if sustained winds exceed 30km/h or if gusts pose a risk to the structural integrity of the simulator setup.</li>
        <li><strong>Rain & Moisture:</strong> As a mobile outdoor/semi-outdoor service, we cannot operate in active rain or high-moisture conditions. In the event of rain, equipment must be powered down and covered immediately.</li>
        <li><strong>Provider Discretion:</strong> Sim2U reserves the sole right to determine if weather conditions are safe for operation. This decision is made with the safety of the participants and the protection of the equipment as the priority.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4.1 Cancellations & Rescheduling</h3>
    <p>If an event is cancelled due to inclement weather <strong>prior to setup</strong>, the client will be offered a priority reschedule date or a [Percentage]% refund of the booking fee. If weather forces a shutdown <strong>after setup has commenced</strong>, the full booking fee remains payable.</p>
